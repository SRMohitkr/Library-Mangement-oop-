📚 Simple Library - A Python OOP Demo
A beginner-friendly Python project demonstrating the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating a simple library. This program highlights how data is managed in memory and the concept of non-persistence.

✨ Features
Create a Library: Instantiate a Library object to hold your books.

Add Books: A method to add new books to your library's collection.

Display Books: A method to print a list of all the books currently in the library.

Count Books: A method to get the total number of books available.

🧠 Key Concept: Data in Memory
This program is a perfect illustration of data volatility.

The Library object and the list of books you add to it exist only in the computer's memory (RAM) while the script is running. Once the program terminates, this memory is cleared, and all the data is lost.

If you run the program again, it will create a brand new, empty library. It has no memory of the books added in the previous run. This demonstrates that the data does not persist—it isn't saved to a file or database.# Library-Mangement-oop-
